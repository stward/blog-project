bottom.</p>\n          <p>In JS, there are types of data structures called arrays. Arrays keep pieces of data together in an ordered list:</p>\n          <pre>\n            {`\n              var arr = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]\n            `}\n          </pre>\n          <p>Each individual data in the array has two main components: a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>. The key determines the datas location in the array, and the value is exactly what it sounds like, the data value. JS uses 0-based numbering, so the first element in a list starts at 0, as opposed to 1. In the example above, the value \"a\" has the key 0, \"b\" has the key 1, and so on. This crucial fact leads to how loops are performed:</p>\n          <h3>Iterators</h3>\n          <pre>\n            {`\n              function forLoop (a) {\n                for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {\n                  console.log(a[i])\n                }\n              }\n              forLoop()\n              // prints \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" to console\n            `}\n          </pre>\n          <p>In the example above, the forLoop function uses an iterator to cycle through the array. The variable \"i\" is initially set to zero. As long as the value of i is less than the length of the array (4), the loop will continue to evaluate. At the end of the loop, i is incremented by one. The operation is complete once the value of i has matched the array length.</p>\n          <p>The purpose of the loop is to log each value in the array.

I was a marketing assistant at a place called the&nbsp;\n        <a href='https://www.comfortcompany.com' target='_blank'>Comfort Company</a>, a manufacturer of\n        high-end wheelchair seating products. I came to the job with a basic knowledge of html, and was tasked\n        with simple design work using Adobe tools, and generally doing odd jobs like data management in spreadsheets,\n        pdf document creation, coordinating company events, etc.\n      </div>\n      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>~~~~~~~</div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div>\n        At the time, the company had one person in charge of developing their website, and the intention\n        was that once I had increased my coding skills further, I would enter a role as an assistant to this person.\n        Well, a little under a year into the job, the lead developer quit, or was fired, or something happened; who knows?\n        They were gone. This event dropped the entire website squarely onto my shoulders.\n      </div>\n      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>~~~~~~~</div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div>\n        I had no choice. I had to figure something out. A trial by fire. Little by little, I taught myself how to code.\n        The original website was made using a pre-built cart engine called X-Cart, which is a massive conglomeration of\n        template files. In addition, the thing had been edited by my predecessor beyond recognition. More often than not, I was\n        completely stymied. I got a lot of help from the fellows at <a href='https://jtechcommunications.com' target='_blank'>JTech Communications</a>.\n      </div>\n      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>~~~~~~~</div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div>\n        After three years of doing it on my own, it was becoming pretty clear that I was reaching the upper limits of\n        what I could teach myself. Then I noticed that JTech was hiring for a Junior Developer position. Perfect! I applied,\n        and I was in. For two quality years, I worked as an understudy, planning and programming many website contracts,\n        and also spending a lot of time as the Project Manager.\n      </div>\n      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>~~~~~~~</div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div>\n        Then another opportunity came along. It came to my attention that my old friend&nbsp;\n        <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/bent-cardan/' target='_blank'>Bent Cardan</a>, who was living in New York\n        at the time, was getting into this coding thing. We got in touch, shared some stories, and then started\n        talking about going into business for ourselves. I left JTech, and we started a little company called\n        Chairlift Development. We had an...interesting year. As it turned out, we ended up doing a lot of work for\n        my old employer, the Comfort Company. It eventually became clear that they really needed another\n        full-time developer, not just a contractor. Bent and I parted ways, I went back to work for the CC, and he\n        went on to become a very successful developer in his own right.\n      </div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>~~~~~~~</div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div>\n        For four years, I was once more the lead (well, the only) web developer for the Comfort Company. I completely rebuilt\n        the website from scratch, using Node.js, MongoDB, and NGINX. Front-end, back-end, database, server, I did it all.\n        There were many late nights, and many stressful hours, but there are few things more rewarding than being able to\n        look at a project and say \"I made that whole damn thing.\" When I look at some of that old code I cringe, but I also know\n        how much I've improved since then.\n      </div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>~~~~~~~</div>\n      <div className='spacer15'></div>\n      <div>\n        And now here I am. Again, I found myself reaching the limits of what I could teach myself, and I knew there were\n        a lot of things I could be doing better. I needed some formal instruction. I said farewell to the CC a second time, and\n        I enrolled in the <a href='http://www.bigskycodeacademy.org/' target='_blank'>Big Sky Code Academy</a>. I think, at long last,\n        I'm learning how to \"do it right.\" We'll see what's next!\n      </div>\n      <div className='spacer30'></div>\n      <div className='spacer30'></div>\n      <div className='aboutMeBox'>\n        Spencer Ward was born in Castro Valley, California.
